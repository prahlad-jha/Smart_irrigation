This .pkl file is a pickle file, which is just a way Python uses to save things like trained machine learning models so they can be used later.

From the file name — Farm_Irrigation_System — it seems like this file contains a machine learning model that was trained to decide whether a farm needs irrigation.

It probably looks at things like:

Temperature

Humidity

Soil moisture

...and other sensor data

Based on that info, the model can say:
“Yes, the field needs water” or “No, it’s fine for now.”
