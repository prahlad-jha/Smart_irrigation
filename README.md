# ðŸŒ± Smart Irrigation System (ML + Python)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is a **Smart Irrigation System** built using **Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Machine Learning**.  
It predicts whether irrigation is required based on **soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and rainfall** data.  
The model is trained and saved as a **`.pkl` file**, which can be reused without retraining.
